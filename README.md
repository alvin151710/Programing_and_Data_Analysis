Air pollution is one of the most critical environmental challenges affecting urban populations globally. In cities like Beijing, particulate matter such as PM2.5 poses serious health risks due to its ability to penetrate deep into the respiratory system. The aim of this coursework is to develop a predictive and interactive solution to analyse and forecast PM2.5 concentrations using publicly available air quality data from multiple monitoring stations in Beijing. The assignment is divided into five interrelated tasks, covering the entire data science pipeline from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to machine learning model building and application development using Streamlit
