Data scientists or machine learning engineers are not web developers and they're not interested in spending weeks learning to use these frameworks to build web apps. Instead, they want a tool that is easier to learn and to use, as long as it can display data and collect needed parameters for modeling.\n",

        "* **Fast and Easy Deploymen**t ‚Äì Create stunning machine learning or data science apps within minutes or hours, rather than spending days or months.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Seamless Integration** ‚Äì Compatible with popular Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Keras, PyTorch, and SymPy (for LaTeX rendering).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Minimal Code, Maximum Impact** ‚Äì Build impressive and functional web apps with less effort.\n",
